	title = Who are you?
	text = It is the end of the fifteenth century and European interests in the Orient. With so many exotic wares being discovered and new luxuries being traded demands are rising for faster and safer routes east.
	text = Rumours are circulating in the courts of royalty that in fact the world may not be flat, but round. The only logical conclusion from this is that the unexplored seas to the west can lead only to the east.
	text = Like your kin before you and as a proud and ambitious citizen of Europe you have come before the highest nobility to seek their blessing in your voyage west. You cannot promise them success, but nor do you gaurantee them failure. You are but one person, eager to join the Age of Discovery.
	text = lol \n lol
	text = You may have the finance, but before they will support your journey, the court ponders what skills you might have that could lead to success. Your failure would be their embarrassment. Are you a blacksmith, skilled in weaponcraft? Or maybe you are a farmer, with unparalled knowledge of plants and fauna.
	text = \n
	text = You begin to speak, and with unabated courage you begin to share your history...

	title = the mother ship
	text = You begin to talk about your life as a $ROLE$. You weave wonderful stories of joy and success. The court seems delighted and it is not long until they unanimously agree to support your cause. With their support and your own money, there is much opportunity to bring your dream of exploration to reality.
	text = They offer to sell you wares and goods of all kind. Some useful, some not. Of course, it is agreed that rum is always useful. But soon the talk turns to more important things. What crew will you take? And what ship? How much food do you need for the journey?
	text = These are questions you do not exactly know the answer to, but the court gives you advice. Maybe a grand warship? But no! A small caraval will find success much quicker. Perhaps a galleas in the middle?
	text = Space is important, so you can bring back treasure and other luxurious goods. But then they argue that speed is also of importance. After all, if a new route is discovered, they can capitalise it sooner. Unfortunately, speed and size do not always mix.
	text = Although they cannot all decide, they agree to offer you a selection based on your wealth. When it comes to choosing a ship, ultimately the choice is yours.
