EVENT = {
	ID = 1
	title = north atlantic voyage
	text = Our journey begins here in the Atlantic. The familiar waters off the coast of France. The English channel lies behind, the scent of fresh bread and memories of home fading slowly into the horizon as the journey begins.
		
	option = {
		text = Lets just go due west where it is warmer.
		link = 2 #Open Atlantic
		
	option = {

EVENT = {
	ID = 2
	title = Life at sea
	text = As we set off to the west you feel full of vigour and excitement. We are going on an adventure!
	text = Your charts tell you that it would be only a five day detour to visit the Azores. Perhaps it is a chance to restock and gather knowledge?
		
	option = {
		text = Continue on course!
		link = 3 #Open Atlantic
		
	option = {
		text = Maybe we should stop by the Azores?

EVENT = {
	ID = 3
	title = Land gamble
	text = They say there are rumours of land further in the north, yet our beliefs hold true to find land in the west. Which way should we go?
		
	option = {
		text = West I tell you!
		link = 4 #Uncharted waters
		
	option = {
		text = North, I say!
		link = 10 #Open Ocean

EVENT = {
	ID = 4
	title = Uncharted Waters
	text = We have done great work exploring the seas that no man has previously! There appears to be nothing out here to see, other than endless water. Nevertheless, it is still thrilling to know that you are on the first known ship to pass through these waters!
		
	option = {

		link = 5 #Land?

EVENT = {
	ID = 5
	title = land!
	text = Just as the crews moral begins to the petter, a new world comes into sight. There appears to be a large peninsula and perhaps some islands. There is a passage between them. Marvellous!
	option = {

		link = 6 #Canada south
		
	option = {

		link = 13 #Canada bay

EVENT = {
	ID = 6
	title = more land
	text = You sail past the mouth of the passage and follow the coastline south. Your cartographer carefully maps everything that you see. Perhaps we should make land and see what this new world has to offer?
	option = {
		text = Good idea!
		link = north_america_canada.6 #Canada south
		
	option = {
		text = Lets keep following the coastline south.
		link = atlantic_central.12 #north USA

EVENT = {
	ID = 7
	title = Rough waters
	text = The Atlantic waters are rough on your ship as your journey begins. It is hard to imagine what might be out there, or even if the you will make it. Maybe we should try and preserve ourselves.
	option = {
		text = I like it in the North Atlantic.
		link = 8 #north atlantic
		
	option = {
		text = Lets go somewhere a bit calmer.
		link = 10 #open ocean

EVENT = {
	ID = 8
	title = Great North Atlantic
	text = As you muse upon your journey you find some beauty in the water you now float in. Although it would seem there is nothing out here.
	option = {
		text = Maybe we need to go even further north.
		link = 9 #Fisherman
		
	option = {
		text = Maybe heading south is the best idea
		link = 11 #warmer water

EVENT = {
	ID = 9
	title = The fisherman
	text = As you travel further north and the air gets colder you begin to doubt your chances of finding anything. Then, as if an offering from above, you spot a small boat floating in the water. And in the boat is a figure with a net. A fisherman. With great curiosity your draw your ship nearer, taking care not to alarm the person or present yourself as a threat. Your efforts are useless. You draw near enough for the fisherman to notice you, panic and rapid begin to paddle away. Poor guy. But the message is clear, there must some kind of land with a settlement nearby.
	option = {
		text = Follow him!

	option = {
		text = Lets try his fishing spot.
		link = 39 #Food jackpot.

EVENT = {
	ID = 10
	title = Open Ocean
	text = Now, we are sailing in a vast open ocean of nothingness. Not an island in sight. Only the infinite blue horizon, stretching in every direction. Perhaps we should consult with out advisors and decide on a heading. The lookout suggests perhaps we should move out toward the north. It may be colder and more dangerous, but there must be land somewhere amongst the ice sheets of the arctic. You map keeper disagrees. The charts he has been keeping indicate a strong possibility of reaching the East by continuing our course west.
	option = {
		text = Follow the lookout.

	option = {

EVENT = {
	ID = 11
	title = Songs of the Sea
	text = Sailing has been smooth and uneventful the last few days. Your journey across the ocean has not yet yielded benefits, but your crew stay positive with tales of home and songs of the sea. Any disagreements between friends quickly melts as well as become infected by the jolly life of freedom aboard the ship. Plenty of rum is drank and many an orange consumed. Ave! They sing, the old phrase coming back from the depths of history. Glory be to us, our quest and...

EVENT = {
	ID = 12
	title = The Spirit of Adventure
	text = What better way to call forth the spirit of adventure than to discover a new land ripe for exploring? After many days and nights of mutton-filled feasts and jolly song we have fresh new land entering our sights. The route to the East must be true! It is beautiful. Lush green forests and stark mountains. Your map keeper is going crazy with delight and the lookout just wonâ€™t keep quiet about all the land he can see. This is truly something marvellous.

EVENT = {
	ID = 14
	title = beyond the isles
	text = For many days the air has grown colder. The wind has been frigid and rain falls in cold, fat drops. The English coast, whilst beautiful, has long vanished into the distance. Fortunately, your cabins are well kept and you crew stay warm from hard labour and hot mead. The journey continues!

EVENT = {
	ID = 18
	title = The great ice shelf
	text = After many cold days and many cold nights the glistening blue of the ocean begins to give way to the faded white of ice. As travel continues this ice begins to gain depth and height, eventually becoming a great ice shelf your path. If this is the passage then it must be at this point that it splits in two.

	option = {
		text = Perhaps the north will hold passage around the ice.
		link = 19 #Narrow passage

	option = {
		text = Perhaps the west will hold passage around the ice.
		link = 32 #Wide passage

EVENT = {
	ID = 19
	title = Western pass
	text = After passing through a narrow passage it quickly becomes apparent this is no no ordinary ice shelf. The land to the south intrigues you, but the lust for discovery to the west compels you onward. Eventually another landmass looms ahead and the passage splits, again, in two.

	option = {
		text = The passage to the north will lead us out of this maze.
		link = 105 #freeze to death

	option = {
		text = We must find passage to the south.
		link = 20 #the bay

EVENT = {
	ID = 20
	title = The great bay
	text = As the ship travels south the passage opens up wide. Land lines the horizon on both sides. Surely this cannot continue forever. Indeed, a few days later and land begins to fill the horizon on almost all sides. The ship has entered a great bay and a whole new land. You have not found a passage to the east, but you have found a mysterious new land.

	option = {
		text = We must make landfall at once!
		link = 20 #north canada land
		
		
EVENT = {
	ID = 21
	title = the arctic
	text = Vast expanses of ice sheets loom ahead of your ship. There is no way you could possibly break through it. The temperature is freezing and you have to avoid sailing too fast to avoid the wind chill. Your lookout spots a waterway through the ice and into the beyond. The ice around here has been mapped before. Is it really worth submitting yourself and your crew to this cold-hearted punishment?
		
	option = {
		text = Too right, let us sail back to warmer waters.
		link = 27
		
	option = {
		text = The allure of a new route to the east is just too great. Proceed!

EVENT = {
	ID = 22
	title = breaking the ice
	text = You go deeper and deeper into the Arctic. This is where no man has gone before.
	text = It is difficult to know where land stops and ice begins. Luckily, it is a fairly warm summer and your ship does not find it too hard to crush through the thin ice.
	text = It does not last forever. Eventually it begins to get tougher and tougher. The ship is going nowhere. It is cold and it is hopeless. We need to turn back or everyone will perish.

	option = {
		text = The summer will propel us through.

EVENT = {
	ID = 23

	text = Your cartographer calls out to you. The North Pole! We have made it! We are on top of the world! For all the joy this brings, your crew still want to turn back.
	modify = {

	option = {

		link = 24 #far north Canada
		conditions = {
			role = admiral

EVENT = {
	ID = 24
	title = breaking ice
	text = Exhilarated by the discoveries, the crew presses on. The ship breaks the ice, no matter how sluggish it may be. The Arctic wind fills her sails and drives her forward. It can only get warmer from here.

	option = {
		text = Into the east we go!
		link = 25 #North Alaska approach

EVENT = {
	ID = 25
	title = Great fjords
	text = As you navigate the ship between unknown islands and through uncharted channels the grandeur of the journey sinks into the crew. They have travelled through the bitter ice and into the east to find new lands. And new lands they have found. So now, passing amongst great fjords you cannot help but smile, for this is truly remarkable.

	option = {

	title = iceland
	text = As you escape the ice you come across the familiar island of Iceland! The locals tell you stories of some far away land, Greenland. There are also rumours of a lonely island, Bermuda, out in the Atlantic expanse. One joker even mentions something about travelling east past north Scandinavia.

	modify = {

	title = Native village
	text = What?! You found a village of people here in Greenland! They appear to be natives. After some work the language barrier is crudely broken. You explain your quest to them, with some effort. They are intrigued. They say they can take you to the north pole, or suggest that you may find something off the west coast.

EVENT = {

	title = Northern pass
